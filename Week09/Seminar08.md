## Seminar 08 - NoSQL Databases (part 1)

In this seminar, we will play with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database), a **document-based* database.

### Activity 1 (tutorial) - MongoDB Atlas

Make sure you can connect to your [MongoDB Atlas cluster](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).

### Activity 2 (tutorial) - PyMongo

Open the [ex_PyMongoDB.ipynb](./ex_PyMongoDB.ipynb) notebook for some example code on how you can connect and use your MongoDB Atlas cluster through the [pymongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library.

### Activity 3 (homework / self-study) - MongoDB Shell

Go to the [MongoDB Shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.4/mongo/) page/documentation and follow the instructions to download and install the software. Once you have it working on your machine, just follow the instructions and examples.

### Activity 4 (homework / self-study) - MongoDB Database Tools

Have a look at the [MongoDB Database Tools](https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/) documentation for installing some additional software, including the `mongoimport` script that allows for importing example databases (from JSON files) into your Atlas cluster.

If you manage to install the `mongoimport` tool, go to this [tutorial page](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/aggregation-zip-code-data-set/) on **aggregation functions** over `zip code` data.
